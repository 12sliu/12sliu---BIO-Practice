The largest digit (in terms of characters in the word) has 5 characters.
A transformation adds or removes 5 character.
Any digit can be added or removed to a number in a transformation.
If a digit is entirely removed in a transformation without any other letters touched, the remainder is guaranteed to be a number.
A digit can be added to a number in a transformation, where the remainder is also guaranteed to be a number.
This means that a number can have all of its original digits removed and the digits of the new number added one by one.
So there is at least one number ladder for every integer.
