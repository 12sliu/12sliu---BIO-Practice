Yes, it is always possible to make at least one move.
When the first pile is moved at the start of the game, that creates a pile of 2 cards, which can be moved onto each other.
These cards of the first pile will stay touching each other in their pile no matter what actions are taken.
When the finished game is dealt into a new game, the cards of the first pile will be distributed next to each other.
It is guaranteed one can be moved onto the other, as they must share a value or suit, due to one of them being moved onto the other in the first match.
Therefore at least one action can be taken.
